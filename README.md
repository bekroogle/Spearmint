Spearmint
=========

New menu icon for Linux Mint

cd to spearmint. The image spearmint-right.png is a photo-realistic spearmint leaf with a transparent background.

To set it as your menu icon: open 'Cinnamon Settings', click 'Panel', click the file chooser labeled 'Menu icon' (just below 'Menu text'), and find the 'spearmint-right.png' and open it.

All done.
